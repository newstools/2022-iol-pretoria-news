Pretoria - Despite the bitterly cold winter, the number of active Covid-19 cases has continued to drop dramatically in recent weeks in Pretoria. The City of Tshwane said it had noticed a week-on-week decrease in the number of active cases, a trend that had continued throughout June. City spokesperson Selby Bokaba said during the first week of this month, their report showed a decrease in cases by up to 41%, moving from 1 966 active cases during the month of May, to 1 160 cases. He said in the same period, Region 3, which had the highest number of active cases, also registered a decrease of 49%, from 627 to 322 cases. Region 3 has areas such as Atteridgeville, Pretoria West, Phillip Nel, Danville, the CBD, Brooklyn, Sunnyside and Hatfield. Areas such as Laudium, Centurion, Olievenhoutbosch, and Lyttelton – or Region 4 – recorded the second-highest number of active cases, but a 43% drop from 495 cases to just 283. In Region 6, which includes Nellmapius, there was a decrease of 35%, from 419 to 274. According to the report, Region 7 continued to record the least number of active cases at 13 from 12, followed by Region 5, which had witnessed a 22% decrease, moving from 37 to 29 as of June 7. Bokaba said the City had managed to contain the upward trajectory as the most recent report released last week Tuesday had shown further decreases in the number of active cases in the capital city. Figures had continued to go down as of June 21 to a 42% decrease, with the current number of active cases sitting at 448 from last week’s 766. Unfortunately, Region 3 still recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the city at 131 active cases. Bokaba said despite this, the region had registered a 47% decrease as compared with last week’s figure of 248. Region 4’s numbers also decreased once more by 43% moving from 192 to 110. In the same period, he said, the other five regions had encouragingly registered less than 100 active cases, with 96 cases in Region 6, and 61 cases in Region 1. Regions 2 and 5 recorded 22% and 21% decreases, respectively, while Region 7 continued to report the least number of active cases with its figure sitting at a paltry 3 from last week’s 8. Meanwhile, the City had continued with its vaccination efforts and recorded that as of June 19, there were 1 216 312 persons fully vaccinated, with 2 338 600 vaccines administered. Pretoria News
