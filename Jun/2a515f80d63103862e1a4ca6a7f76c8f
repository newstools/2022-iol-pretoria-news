Pretoria - True to his promise, gospel star Tshidi Chauke literally brought the house down during the live recording of his debut DVD at the Grace Kingdom Community Centre in Ga-Rankuwa last Saturday night. Chauke, a former Tshwane Gospel Choir lead singer, took the packed auditorium on a spiritual healing journey. He performed hits such as Tshwarela, Morena Utlwa Dithapelo and Tiko Ra Xikwembu, all in all, 16 songs that will form part of the DVD. Former Idols SA contestant Mmatema Moremi mesmerised the audience with a song titled Heal My Pain. Before belting out the inspiring lyrics, she first spoke of meeting Chauke in 2012 when he was driving a Tshwane Gospel Choir bus. “Here I am today, having been booked by him,” she said. Chauke’s “sisters” Neoentle Rapetswa and Mpho Langeni, also backing vocalists throughout the show, leapt to the spotlight when they performed one of the songs. But apart from the man of the moment, Chauke, the audience rose to its feet with the larger-than-life gospel icon Dr Tumi performing some of the popular songs. There was also a performance by Omega Khunou. During the performance, Chauke thanked the church for providing the venue, sponsors Royal Funerals SA and members of the audience who came in large numbers. Pretoria News
