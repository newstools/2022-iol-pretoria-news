Pretoria - The City of Tshwane’s A Re Yeng bus transit services were suspended effective from yesterday, leaving commuters scrambling for alternative public transport modes. The City said it was “engaging with the Tshwane Rapid Transit (Pty) Ltd management on mechanisms to iron out the glitches that have led to the service interruption”. "Commuters will be kept abreast of the developments and informed as soon as the service is restored. “The City apologises to the commuters for the inconvenience caused,” it said. No reason was given for the suspension of the service. Earlier this month, the bus service operations were suspended due to the strike by members of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa. Commuters took to social media platform to vent their frustrations and criticised the City and the bus operating company for poor service. One commuter said: “This is becoming a weekly event; are the Tshwane entities operating and will they operate tomorrow." Another commuter on Facebook said: “So now I must make use of Tshwane Bus Service, which is not reliable because of poor maintenance and a total lack of leadership.” This was followed by: “You are a disgrace for a service provider; you have taken money from the public and promised to provide services. “We want our money refunded to use for alternative transport.” Another Facebook user agreed and posted: “Just admit it that the Tshwane council is incapable of running any kind of service delivery properly. “Only telling us now while those buses have not been working for almost a week. “Time for commuters to go and collect our money from City of Tshwane. Pay back our money, you are stealing from us.” Pretoria News
