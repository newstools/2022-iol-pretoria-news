Pretoria - More confusion and miscommunication surrounds the case of an eight-year-old girl from Mamelodi, whose throat was allegedly slashed by her mother’s lover, Sipho Nkosi after a quarrel. The 31-year-old made his fourth appearance at the Mamelodi Magistrate’s Court on Monday. He failed to appear at the same court on May 30 due to a miscommunication between Silverton Magistrate’s Court, Mamelodi Magistrate’s Court and the Correctional Centre he is held at. On Monday, it was heard that the case was ready for trial, and the next court date was set at June 15 in the Pretoria Regional Court. The father of the girl, who cannot be named to protect the child, said: “Now we hear that there is a bail application hearing on June 10, which is this coming Friday. This is the same date where the suspect is supposed to appear in the Silverton case. “It looks like there is confusion that is intentionally caused,” he said. He said Nkosi’s lawyers could not just decide to apply for bail out of nowhere. The father was not impressed with the confusions and miscommunication in the case, and said it was not explained to them what would happen since the accused was double-booked. “The NPA needs to treat this case seriously. This person was arrested at least seven times and he seems to always get away somehow, he was fined R1 000 for admission of guilt on another gender-based violence matter, clearly our voices are not being listened to,” the man said. Nkosi initially abandoned his bail application when he made his second appearance at the Mamelodi Magistrate’s Court. Pretoria News
