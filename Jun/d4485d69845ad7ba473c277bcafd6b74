Meanwhile, Indo-Asian News Service reported that leaked emails sent from Musk revealed that Telsa had a “very tough quarter” and needs to rally. “We actually build great, real products that people love and make their lives and the world better,” Musk said. “This has been a very tough quarter, primarily due to supply chain and production challenges in China, so we need to rally hard to recover!” he said. Musk is said to often send emails to rally the troops at the end of each quarter in order to push for better deliveries in the coming one. IOL
