Pretoria - The Gauteng Traffic Police High-Speed Unit has vowed to clamp down on speedsters with the assistance of the latest technological devices. In fact, the unit reported that its recent successful arrest of speedsters were due to the use of the latest devices such as the Moving Violation Recorders. According to the unit, the recorder was a much welcome boost to law enforcement’s efforts to curb speeding on South African roads, as the device recorded the average speed measured over a minimum of 500 metres. Following that the event was recorded and downloaded for investigation and prosecution purposes. Just this past weekend the Gauteng Traffic Police reported they had arrested seven drivers after they were caught speeding during high-speed unit operations conducted along the major provincial routes and freeways. The average speed of the drivers arrested ranged from 166km/h to 215km/h with their ages ranging from 32 to 60. The highest speedster arrested was a 41-year-old who was caught driving a Silver Mercedes Benz G63 at 215km/h on the N1 South. The speedster, who was detained at Sinoville police station, informed the police that he was speeding to escape from hijackers. The other offenders detained at various police stations such as Olievenhoutbosch, Olifantsfontein and Wierdabrug. The speedsters are expected to appear at various magistrate’s courts this week to face charges relating to reckless and negligent driving with an alternative charge of exceeding the prescribed maximum limit of 120km/h on a freeway. With this in mind, the Gauteng Traffic Police reiterated its call to drivers to adhere to the rules of the road. Spokesperson Sello Maremane said: “Excessive speeding contributes to the high number of road fatalities in the province. We call on drivers to adhere to the speed limit on Gauteng major routes in order to save lives. “The Gauteng Traffic Police High-Speed Unit will continue to apprehend drivers who endanger the lives of others.” Pretoria News
