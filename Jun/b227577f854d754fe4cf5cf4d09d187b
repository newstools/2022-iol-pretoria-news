Pretoria - Former ANC member and Limpopo government spokesperson Sello Lediga has joined ActionSA as its provincial chairperson. The news was announced by party president Herman Mashaba yesterday. Lediga is no stranger to provincial politics. In 1990, with the unbanning of the ANC, he became a party member and served on the executive of his branch in Nchabeleng, Sekhukhune. In 2013, the ANC top 6 appointed him as part of a task team to administer the province after Cassel Mathale’s provincial executive was placed under administration. He was appointed provincial spokesperson. Speaking to the Pretoria News after the announcement, Lediga said he would contribute to ActionSA’s developing ideology and policy framework. “The focus will be on disillusioned voters who have lost hope. With the Limpopo Congress of Traditional leaders of SA chairman as our member, I will strengthen relations with chiefs, a critical consideration in rural provinces.” Lediga vowed to fight poverty, unemployment and a corrupt administration. “We are going to grow our membership by engaging in community development initiatives. Practical programmes like cleaning up the province (anti-littering); community food gardens development; providing extra classes over weekends to matrics; etc.” Ledibga said he resigned from the ANC in 2014 because he could not stomach the factionalism, corruption and failed government of the ANC at the expense of Limpopo residents. In 2015 he published a book, Tenders and the Fall of Limpopo, which exposed the culture of looting in the ANC in Limpopo and how it had destroyed the province. “The people of Limpopo will have, for the first time, a powerful alternative to the continued failure and corruption of the ANC,” said Mashaba.
