Strauss & Co, South Africa’s leading auction house, is heading to Pretoria on Monday 20 June 2022, giving Pretoria residents the opportunity to have the value of their art assessed and to learn more about the South African art market. Taking place at the historic Van Wouw House Museum in Brooklyn, Pretoria from 9am – 4pm on Monday 20 June, the valuation day will allow collectors to consign their artworks to forthcoming live and online auctions for 2022.

Strauss & Co will be looking for examples of the artist’s linocuts, etchings, drawings, watercolours and oil paintings.
