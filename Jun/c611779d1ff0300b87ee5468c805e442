The June 2022 Household Affordability Index in June shows that the average cost of the household food basket is R4 688.81.  The index tracks food price data from 44 supermarkets and 30 butcheries, in Johannesburg, Durban, Cape Town, Pietermaritzburg and Springbok. The Pietermaritzburg Economic Justice & Dignity Group (PMBEJD) compiles the household affordability index each month and is a civil society initiative founded in July 2018. According to the justice group, “Month-on-month the average cost of the household food basket increased by R78.92 (1.7%), from R4 609.89 in May 2022 to R4 688.81 in June 2022”.  “Year-on-year, the average cost of the household food basket increased by R560.57 (13.6%), from R4 128.23 in June 2021 to R4 688.81 in June 2022.” Food baskets increased in all areas, according to the group: This situation raises three red flags: increased hunger, increased risk of social instability, and a general deterioration of health – with short-term and long-term consequences, the PMBEJD said.  In July public transport fares are set to increase (including the cost of transporting children to school), and the annual electricity tariff hikes will come into effect.  The group adds that food price inflation is likely to continue climbing, as winter enters its second month. Your staple foods that have increased in price: WHAT HAS CAUSED THE INCREASE? The PMBEJD argue that all the local and global factors driving food prices upwards have continued.  “Locally, the severe disruptions on our major transport routes, particularly between Gauteng and Durban, have impacted on food transportation (blockages, protests, bad road, accidents). Much higher commodity prices, production and logistical costs will continue to drive prices upwards and are likely to continue rising for the rest of 2022.” Statistics South Africa’s latest consumer price index (CPI), for May 2022, shows that headline inflation was 6.5%, and for the lowest expenditure quintiles 1-3, it is 8%, 7.4% and 6.8% respectively. CPI food inflation was 7.8%, public transport was 12.5%, and electricity was 14.4%. BUSINESS REPORT
