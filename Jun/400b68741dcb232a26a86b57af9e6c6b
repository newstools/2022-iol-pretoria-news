Pretoria - The Ga-Rankuwa reservoir has been described as a disaster waiting to happen. The reservoir, located in Zone 1, has cracked walls which have caused water to leak into nearby houses. MelodiForum Service Delivery Monitoring Group founder Oda Masemola said he had reported the matter as far back as 2018, and was promised it would be attended to. “There is a quarry next to the reservoir. Sometimes they use dynamite to loosen the rocks, so I suspect that it caused the reservoir walls to crack.” The reservoir has been cracking bit by bit. “In May, my aunt complained that water leaking from the reservoir was flooding their yards and houses, especially at night. “She said their houses were being surrounded by water. The reservoir is located at the top of the mountain, and the water flows to the house at the bottom. “Most of the houses have four rooms. The water gets under the door and into the houses and damages whatever is inside,” Masemola said. Masemola, who has reported the matter to the City of Tshwane as well as the Department of Water and Sanitation, said if the reservoir burst, Zone 1, 4 and surrounding areas would be flooded.  “There are over 5 000 houses and the number of people in those areas is huge. So many people will be affected if it ever breaks.” The DA’s Ofentse Madzebatela said community members had alerted them about the reservoir being damaged and vandalised, and requiring attention. The City of Tshwane had yet to comment by late yesterday.  Pretoria News
