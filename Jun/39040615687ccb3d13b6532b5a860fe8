Pretoria - Two of four suspects were arrested in Pretoria soon after they had allegedly hijacked a bakkie from a Pakistani national. They were nabbed by Tshwane Metro Police Department members in Region 1 Sector 1, who reacted swiftly and stopped the bakkie on the Mabopane Highway at the Ruth First Street off-ramp. One suspect was driving the bakkie, while the other four drove off when they realised that the bakkie had been stopped and the driver arrested. The officers gave chase, and the suspects abandoned their car near Soshanguve Block L and fled on foot. They managed to apprehend one suspect. The vehicle they were driving was searched and officers found three firearms, including a Glock similar to the service pistol used by members of the department. The other two firearms are similar to SAPS pistols. The three firearms will be subject to further investigation. The recovered Hyundai Sonata car will also be assessed to see if it is linked to other crimes. The hijacked bakkie was recovered and two suspects were arrested for hijacking, pointing a firearm and possession of illegal firearms. Investigations will continue to find the other three suspects. “Well done to the members for their hard work and dedication as we continue to clean up Tshwane,” said Tshwane Metro Police Department spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba. Those who might have more information regarding this incident can contact their nearest SAPS, or the Tshwane Metro Police Department on 012 358 7095/7096. Pretoria News
