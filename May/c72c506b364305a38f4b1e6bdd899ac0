Pretoria - The six suspects arrested on Tuesday in connection with the VBS bank scandal have all been granted R5 000 bail. Nkhensani Ndengeza ,45, Mabaso Nazo, 39, Rotshidzwa Khazamula, 37, Vuyelwa Matshangaza, 38, Mangaliso Matshangaza, 37, and Lazarus Matshangaza, 43, are some municipal officials and a businessman appeared before the Orkney Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. One of the suspects was in hospital when he was arrested. The gang are facing charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering. They were arrested simultaneously in Johannesburg, Vryburg, Orkney and Klerksdorp respectively for laundering approximately R2.5 million. Speaking to Pretoria News Hawks spokesperson, Colonel Katlego Mogale, said the group was not necessarily arrested directly for the VBS matter but their case was connected. She said: “The probe emanated from the VBS investigation wherein investigators noticed suspicious transactions on the account of Dr Kenneth Kaunda Municipality. Further probing allegedly revealed that between 2017 and 2019, money was allegedly continuously deposited from the Dr Kenneth Kaunda Municipal accounts into the accounts of three municipality officials. She said one of the three officials who has since left the municipality would allegedly routinely make payments into the bank accounts of his wife and brother. “He reportedly also routed more funds into an account belonging to a woman in Johannesburg allegedly under the guise of a tender that was awarded. The woman would subsequently send the money back to him,” Mogale said. Mogale added that the National Head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, Lieutenant General Godfrey Lebeya expressed his gratitude for a job well done to both the investigation and prosecution in ensuring that these suspects are brought before court. "No efforts will be spared in ridding the country of corruption and related activities, '' Lebeya said. Pretoria News
