Pretoria - Two Tshwane Metropolitan Police Department (TMPD) members were performing their duties when they heard an alarming scream from a young man in Ga-Rankuwa. They rushed to the scene and found a young male bleeding from the head and pointing to two men with a bicycle. He said that the men had just robbed him of his money, cellphone and bicycle and hit him on the head with a firearm. The officers chased the suspects who abandoned the bicycle and fled into the bushes. The two officers arrested one suspect while the other one fled.  As they were arresting the suspect, community members approached and some identified the suspect as one of the notorious robbers who is terrorising and robbing community members as they walk to the mall. One person alleged that he was robbed at gun point by the same suspect who took his money, cellphone, clothes and assaulted him. The officers managed to recover all the items taken from the man.  The suspect was arrested for armed robbery and will appear in court soon. Further investigations will hopefully lead to the arrest of the other suspect. Those who have information regarding the incident can contact the nearest police station or the TMPD on 012 358 7095/6. Pretoria News
