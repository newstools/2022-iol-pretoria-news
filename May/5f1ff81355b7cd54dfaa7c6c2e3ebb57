Pretoria - Despite the Limpopo ANC Youth League elective conference collapsing due to disputes of credentials earlier this month, the governing party says it's all systems go for its provincial elective conference. The conference, at which provincial chairperson and premier Stan Mathabatha is seeking a third term as ANC leader, is expected to take place in Polokwane on June 3. About 1 200 delegates are expected to take part. Mathabatha is being challenged for the party’s top job in the province by Public Works MEC Dickson Masemola. According to party provincial spokesperson, Donald Selamolela, the ANC is given the conference a thumbs up after it successfully held four of its five regional conferences. Peter Mokaba, Sekhukhune, Vhembe and Norman Mashabane regions have all held their conferences while Waterberg is expected to do so soon. Speaking to Pretoria News yesterday, Selamolela confirmed that the conference preparatory committee has cleared the 10th elective gathering to proceed with its business following delays. “We are expecting close to 1 200 delegates who are voting and non-voting. We are currently dealing with the last batch of disputes and appeals and there is no significance in terms of the national threshold. The threshold has been reached.” Selamolela added: “We are ready to go for the conference as we have not identified any challenges so far.” The party last held its 9th elective conference which saw Mathabatha re-elected uncontested. Earlier this month, the conference of the governing party’s youth wing in Limpopo collapsed due to disputes. For the past three years, the governing party’s youth league has been run by a task team, following its failure to hold an elective conference. Pretoria News
