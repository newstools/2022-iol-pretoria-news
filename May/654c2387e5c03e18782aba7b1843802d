Pretoria - Members of the Road Traffic Management Corporation's (RTMC) Traffic Academy have pushed forward in the war against drug abuse with the arrest of two suspected drug traffickers. The staff members arrested the pair after they almost caused a deadly road crash, east of Pretoria, on Friday. They were driving a grey sedan, where they narrowly missed colliding head-on with a vehicle in which the RTMC members were travelling in. The members immediately stopped the vehicle. However, one of the suspects jumped out of the vehicle as soon as it was stopped, and attempted to flee with a bag in his hand. Officers gave chase and after he was caught, they found the drugs in the bag. Spokesperson Simon Zwane said a search of the vehicle was conducted, and more drug parcels were discovered. He said the drugs were in powder and crystal form, with the powder substance weighing more than 2.024kg, and the crystals 0.508 grams. Zwane said the suspects were being held at the Hercules police station over drug possession and reckless driving. Investigations are continuing and more charges could be added. “We commend the members of the college for this success. The war against drugs in our communities is a top priority for the government, and we all need to play a role to stop drug peddlers from destroying our communities,” said advocate Makhosini Msibi, RMTC CEO. The pair are expected to appear in the Pretoria Central Magistrate’s Court today. Pretoria News
