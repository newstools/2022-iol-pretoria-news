Cape Town: While South Africa and the rest of the world continue to make strides in recovering from the Covid-19 global pandemic, a new crisis has hit Europe in the form of monkeypox, leaving many in Africa uncertain. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the monkeypox outbreak has infected more than 100 people in about 15 countries including Britain, Portugal, Spain and the US. During his address to the UN's World Health Assembly in Geneva on Sunday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the world was not over the pandemic which has claimed six million lives, with the addition of the monkeypox virus and several other disease outbreaks, such as acute hepatitis in children and Ebola, taking place.
