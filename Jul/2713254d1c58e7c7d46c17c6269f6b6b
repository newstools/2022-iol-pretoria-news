Pretoria - The spring season will bring with it a wonderful treat for shopperholics in Centurion when the new Irene Link retail opens its doors. The mall is part of the Phase 2 of Abland’s R2 billion Irene Link smart precinct development that began in 2019. The stylish and modern 75 000m² mixed-use precinct is located next to the Irene Security Estate in Doringkloof, near the N1. The precinct is already home to numerous commercial buildings, including the Barloworld Logistics and Automotive head offices. It is developed in partnership with Giflo Developments and the SOM Group. Some of the anchor tenants for the mall include Checkers, Woolworths and Dis-Chem. The cherry on top will be a 200m underground shooting range, the first of its kind in the country. Known as Irene Arms, it will be a gun and outdoor shop with a coffee shop. It also has a 10-lane, 25m indoor hand weapon shooting, as well as a 10-lane 200m indoor rifle shooting range. According to Abland managing director Jurgens Prinsloo, the aim was to make Irene Link one of the first smart precincts or cities in Gauteng. He said at the infrastructure phase, the connectivity of the precinct was planned to link all the functions into a smart city with interconnected buildings and security, taxi drop-off sites and a public wi-fi area.
