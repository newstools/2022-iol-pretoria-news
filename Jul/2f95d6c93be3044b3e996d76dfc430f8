Pretoria - The City of Tshwane has disconnected electricity to Prasa House in Hatfield for the second time due to the Passenger Railway Agency of South Africa failing to settle its R11.9 million debt to the municipality. Executive Mayor Randall Williams in January led a team of artisans who disconnected water and electricity to the building and served the rail service provider with a letter of demand for electricity and water consumed at its properties across Tshwane. At the time, Williams said it was irresponsible for such an important organ of state to have so many buildings that it could not keep track of them, but somehow expected to have running water and electricity at all times. Prasa subsequently made a R14m payment towards the bill and R2m thereafter. Since then, the rail agency has been making insignificant payments that did not put a dent on the R11.9m debt, forcing the City to serve them with a final notice on June 9. The City of Tshwane has once again cut off the electricity to the Prasa House in Hatfield, Pretoria for failing to make payments for its R11 million bill. @CityTshwane @Eskom_SA #electricity #Power #eskom #Blackouts pic.twitter.com/opg4pmZCBl Spokesperson for the City, Lindela Mashigo said they served officials with a disconnection letter and asked them to inform their superiors to contact the City and make serious payments towards their account because the City could no longer afford to let them pay for less than what they consume. Williams believes most of the defaulting businesses had their money in their accounts but they were just not paying consistently, but expected the City to carry them on its shoulders as it continued to pay its suppliers like Eskom, Rand Water and Magalies Water.
