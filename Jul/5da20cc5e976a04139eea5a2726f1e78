Pretoria - Limpopo MEC for Sports, Arts and Culture Thandi Moraka has been accused of owning an RDP house, which she is said to have inherited from her late mother in Extension 4, Marapong, in Lephalale. This is despite her being a member of the provincial legislature since 2018. Tebogo Makgotho, 39, who lives in a shack in the yard of the house, accuses Moraka of intimidating and bullying her to vacate the shack. The unemployed mother of a 15-year-old said she had been living in the shack for over five years, from when Moraka’s older brother, Simon Moraka, took her in because she did not have a place to stay. She said: “The trouble started when Thandi (Moraka) found out that she was a beneficiary of the house in June 2020. All along the house was controlled by the brother (Simon) because he was not working, so he was making a living with money from renting out the house. “As soon as Thandi found out that she was the beneficiary from her late mother, she started bullying me and intimidating me to leave the back house because she wanted to sell it. The last time she said that she had sold the house for R150 000 and she wanted to hand over the house to someone else.” Makgotho claimed Moraka went to the house in early July to tell her to vacate the premises.  “I don’t have a plan because I don’t work. So I need money to get out of the house. But she is an MEC and a public servant with a salary and she should not be owning a RDP house.” Moraka has denied she was the owner of the house, saying her brother and her cousins were the new beneficiaries. She said Makgotho was a family friend who looked for help from her family after being kicked out of her family home. Pretoria News
