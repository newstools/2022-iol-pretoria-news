Pretoria - The government is ready and equipped to host the Black Industrialists and Black Exporters Conference scheduled for next Wednesday. Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition Ebrahim Patel said the conference, to he held in Sandton, would be opened by President Cyril Ramaphosa. He said the event would be an ideal opportunity to identify progress in transformation in the economy and information on efforts to increase exports, growth and job creation by black industrialists. The event will feature an exhibitor’s “marketplace”, with industrialists showcasing their products, and also recognise excellence in business with awards that will be given to business persons. Among other objectives, the conference will further highlight and showcase the importance of the African Continental Free Trade Area in enhancing economic development and promoting intra-trade on the continent. Patel said the event would be attended by 500 black industrialists, business people drawn from a range of sectors that include food and beverages, furniture manufacturers, chemical producers, and businesses manufacturing cosmetics and healthcare products. Skill makers, mining companies as well as industrial suppliers, and clothing, textile and footwear firms will be there, with filmmakers, tourism businesses and a number of black South African firms that are involved in innovation and technology businesses. “The conference will be an opportunity to harness broad-based empowerment to boost growth and jobs,” said Patel.
