Pretoria - Nothing should prevent people with disabilities escaping to safety in an emergency. This is according to co-owner and CEO of Evac+Chair, Gavin Glass, who used the KwaZulu-Natal floods as an example in this regard. “The floods have proven why we must be prepared at all times. Though everyone was affected, the most vulnerable were persons living with a disability,” he said. “I believe it’s high time we start prioritising the safety for youth living with disabilities by making sure they are well taken care of in the case of an emergency, be it in malls, workspaces, or schools, with the use of an evacuation chair.” Glass said other forms of accessibility could include provision of handrails and an increase in width in bathrooms in public spaces and homes. “Our homes should be our safe havens. “Families can show support by installing a wheelchair ramp, non-slick seating in the bath and shower, as well as wide doors and hallways.” Sportsman Wiseman Dlamini uses crutches to walk, but on the sports field relies a wheelchair to play. He said not all buildings were wheelchair friendly. However, he said there was progress in making them accessible, especially from the government side. “They try by all means to have manpower to assist you. But this accessibility thing is not only about buildings. “It also affects us in towns where you find street vendors occupying the side walks. If you are in a wheelchair, where are you supposed to push your chair? “It forces you to push your chair in middle of the road, which is risky. “Coming to hotels: about 80% are very accessible, but the problem lies with the space in the bathroom.” Dlamini said building owners needed to prioritise the need of people living with disabilities to be on lower floors, in case of emergencies. “If you going put me on on the sixth floor and there is fire, how will I get down? Because I will not be able to use the lift,” he said. Pretoria News
