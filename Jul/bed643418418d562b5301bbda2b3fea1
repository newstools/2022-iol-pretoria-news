Pretoria - The City of Tshwane has called on role-players in the property development sector to be part of the Property Development Forum, with a view to engage on all issues affecting land development in the municipality. This invitation was made by MMC for Economic Development and Spatial Planning, André le Roux, who described the forum as inclusive and aimed at tackling investment challenges prevalent in the property development sector. “The forum is also aimed at positioning Tshwane as an attractive development destination.” He said the forum covered important subjects around services such as the online tool for submitting land development applications, the calibre of applications received, time lines for approval of land development applications and many other industry-related matters. Currently, forum members include the Capital City Business Chamber, the South African Association of Consulting Professional Planners, the Urban Design Institute of South Africa, and the Pretoria Institute of Architects. “I would like to convey my most sincere gratitude to all our stakeholders in the property development sector and to City officials for putting in the effort to make these sessions a success,” Le Roux said. He said the forum would offer an opportunity for stakeholders and the City to work together “to strengthen Tshwane’s position as a top choice for real estate development by regularly and purposefully engaging on all issues affecting land development in the city”. Those interested in taking part can email lucyn@tshwane.gov.za. Le Roux said his department held four Property Development Forum sessions in the 2021/22 financial year. Pretoria News
