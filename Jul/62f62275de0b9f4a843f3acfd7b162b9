Pretoria - The R5.6 billion investments secured by the Tshwane Economic Development Agency will go a long way in creating more than 700 jobs for one of the projects in Centurion. This is according to agency’s spokesperson Paseka Rakosa, who said multi-million rand investments were secured in the current financial year. Part of the investments would be injected into at least 14 projects in the pipeline to the value of over R2.2bn. Rakosa said an additional R3.4bn investments were attracted in the city against a target of R1.8bn. He said the agency continually embarked on targeted investment promotion campaigns and worked with a range of stakeholders, including provincial and national agencies, to attract investments. “Just recently we took 15 Tshwane-based companies on an outbound mission to Nigeria to exhibit their products and services in order to access new markets on the continent,” he said. Rakosa said approximately 60 Tshwane-based companies were assisted with gearing their products towards exports. “This is achieved through taking companies through a capacity building programme to get them ready for the export market.  “At least R102 million was generated from export against a target of R10m in export sales.” Asked about the benefits of the investments to Tshwane residents, he said: “In fact the target for investment attraction for the year was R1.8bn and agency managed to attract R3.4bn. This exceeded the annual target by R1.6bn. “Further to this, the agency has attracted investments to the value of R2.2bn into the pipeline.  “This R3.4bn project will be located in Centurion; Region 4 will create over 700 jobs.” Pretoria News
